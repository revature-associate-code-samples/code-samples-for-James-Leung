# Trivia Townes
Trivia Townes is an online competitive multiplayer trivia game. Players have the ability 
to create/join a lobby based on 1 of the 9 preset categories. Once a player joins a lobby,
they are placed in a waiting room with the ability to chat with other players. When the game
starts, the players all have 30 seconds to select their answer. Each player receives a score
based on the question difficulty and how quickly they answer the question. When the game is over
all players can check the leaderboard to view how well they compare against everyone else.
