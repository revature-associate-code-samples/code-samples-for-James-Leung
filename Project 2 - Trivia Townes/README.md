# Trivia Townes
Trivia Townes is an online competitive multiplayer trivia game. Players have the ability 
to join or create a custom game lobby. Created lobbies can be found by other players on the server 
lobby page. Once a player joins an existing lobby, they are placed in a waiting room with the 
ability to chat with other players. Every player will be scored based on their accuracy and speed. 
When the game is over, scores are persisted to a database and players can check the leaderboard 
to view how well they compare against everyone else.
