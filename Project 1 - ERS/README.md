# Expense Reimbursement System
The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) manages the process for reimbursing employees 
for any expenses they incurred on company time. Employees can login and submit reimbursement requests,
view their past tickets, and any pending requests. Managers will also be able to login and view all
reimbursement requests with the the ability to approve/deny them.
